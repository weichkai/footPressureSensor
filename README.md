Our foot pressure sensor blablabla

# Instructions to replicate our results



# Data
All data we recorded is available in this cloud (lrz sync&share for TUM students): https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiNrHQxXBhm1jq8pmnKeAs/
If you have trouble accessing it, please let us know.
We could not use a google drive due to lack of space. 

# Programs

4. dafd
5. adsf
6. sadf
First, use log_velostat_sensor_h5.py to collect sensor data. Please ensure that the video is recorded simultaneously to keep the sensor data and the corresponding video synchronized.
Then, use viz_generate_frames.py to visualize and analyze the sensor data along with the video. This script will process the data from the HDF5 files and the video to provide synchronized visualizations, allowing you to examine the correlation between sensor data and video footage.
